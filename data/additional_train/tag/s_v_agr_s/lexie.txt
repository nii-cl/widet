the ripples <wug#590> the pond
the creations <wug#591> the artist
the whispers <wug#592> the rumor
the flames <wug#593> the campfire
the echoes <wug#594> the canyon
the glimpses <wug#595> the scene
the murmurs <wug#596> the crowd
the reflections <wug#597> the lake
the glances <wug#598> the eyes
the vibrations <wug#599> the air
